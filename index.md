Timisoara, Romania

Winter sessions - Theme: Honeypots, Hacking and Community Building

<li>

Honeypots: The internet is getting bigger and bigger and the attacks on
organisations, governments, individuals etc are increasing. It's not a
matter of if you're going to be a target, but when. At some point in
time, attackers will find a way to enter a company's network, some way
or another. They usually do it by trying multiple times, after
conducting reconnaissance activity. Knowing who accesses the company
assets, creating decoys to lure attackers and gain time to implement
defense strategies could be a deal breaker. Learn more about what
honeypots are, how they can be used and what value they can provide to a
company.

</li>

<li>

Hacking: Nowadays we can see an increase in cyber-crime or state
controlled attacks and companies are starting to become more aware for
the need of people with a hacking culture. In Learning path, how to
become a hacker you will find a few steps on how you can be a good guy
into security and help organizations secure their environments.

</li>

<li>

Security Community Building: The founder and the coordinator of
CoderDojo will present the learning steps into security, how can we get
more insights if we participate into CTFs and how we can build a
stronger security community.

## 12th April 2016, OWASP InfoSecTM \#11


<b>Title: Be aware of your bugs, if you aren’t, someone else is</b>
The first session will introduce key concepts necessary in understanding
what is going on “under the hood” of your program and how this
correlates with being a possible victim of an exploit.

We will also dissect a real life exploit to see how this is done “in the
wild” and what can we do to prevent it.

## 15th december 2015, OWASP InfoSecTM \#8

## 17th February 2016, OWASP InfoSecTM \#9



  - <b>Title:</b> A new generation of cryptographic algorithms - IDEA
    NXT".
    <b>Speaker:</b> Andreea Bozesan
    Discover the newest generation of symmetric block ciphers, their
    capabilities, drawbacks and means of testability. A hardware
    implementation is also analyzed for providing metrics to sustain the
    theoretic aspects exposed in the first part of the presentation
  - <b>Title:</b> Software Protection by Code Obfuscation
    <b>Speaker:</b> Ciprian Lucaci
    Complete protection of software against unauthorized access cannot
    be fully guaranteed because with enough resources any protection
    mechanism can eventually be overcome. Thus, the goal is usually to
    make the job of the attacker as difficult as possible. One
    possibility of protecting software intellectual property is through
    different source code obfuscation techniques.
    In this presentation I will briefly discuss different software
    protection techniques and present virtualization obfuscation as an
    effective protection mechanism. Virtualization obfuscation is a
    particular obfuscation technique that aims to protect the
    intellectual property of a software vendor by hiding the
    control-flow of a program P. This talk will present the concept of
    virtualization obfuscation by comparing by introducing the
    advantages and disadvantages compared to other obfuscation
    techniques.

<b>Presentations:</b>
<i>Romanian description</i>

<li>

<b>Speaker:</b> Dan Negrea, Software Engineer în departamentul de
Security al ACI.
Ca departament ne ocupăm de securitatea produselor ACI. Aplication
Security este o felie din ce în ce mai importantă din IT Security. Voi
prezenta Cross-Site Request Forgery, care ocupă poziția 8 în Top-ul
OWASP. Este o vulnerabilitate ușor de exploatat, implicând foarte puțin
cod. Detectarea este de asemenea ușoară.

Dacă ai un website și nu știi ce înseamnă CSRF, mai devreme sau mai
târziu vei afla. Mai bine mai devreme :) Iar, ca simplu utilizator, vei
afla câteva ”Best Practices”.

</li>

<li>

<b>Speaker</b> Radu Ciorbă
Linux and Python fanboy. Problemele de securitate vreau să le înțeleg în
primul rând din curiozitate, dar și pentru a ști ce să evit în sistemele
pe care le construiesc.

Voi prezenta, pe scurt, "The Debian SSL Fiasco" sau cum puțină
"curățenie în cod" bine intenționată a introdus unul dintre cele mai
grave exploituri de securitate din Debian.

</li>

<li>

<b>Speaker:</b> Flavius Oprițoiu
Prezentarea este intitulată "Reliable implementations for cryptographic
systems with testability facilities". Tema abordată o reprezintă
testarea fără degradarea securității în contextul dispozitivelor
criptografice.
