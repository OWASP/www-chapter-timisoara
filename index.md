## OWASP Timisoara \#17: 03 December 2020
Online Event - Due to #COVID19 in #Romania, we have to make the announcement that the #17 OWASP Timisoara Chapter meetup will be ONLINE.
Winter sessions - Theme: Hackers Mindset + Web Indexing and Crawlers

`More about the speakers and topics`

Per Olsson(repolsson), Application Security Engineer at Visma
Per has a background as a developer focusing on the security aspects of software development, he has an unhealthy obsession with passwords and understanding the human behind the hoodie.

*Hackers and the hacker mindset*
Abstract: Per will talk about what hacking actually is, how a hacker thinks compared to for example a developer and about a few different types of hackers.

Tom Hudson (TomNomNom), Security Research Tech Lead at Detectify
Tom is from Bradford in the UK and he is a Open-source tool maker, trainer, talker, fixer, eater, not really a sheep.

*The Unsearchables - Finding Things That Google Doesn't*
Abstract: Google does a fine job of indexing the web for most purposes, but we often want to find things that "regular" people aren't so interested in. Let's take a look at some places you can look, and some techniques you can use to find things that Google doesn't index. We'll look at digging into git repository histories, Docker images, and a few other things to find secrets and other useful information.

Winter sessions - Theme: Honeypots, Hacking and Community Building

<li>

Honeypots: The internet is getting bigger and bigger and the attacks on
organisations, governments, individuals etc are increasing. It's not a
matter of if you're going to be a target, but when. At some point in
time, attackers will find a way to enter a company's network, some way
or another. They usually do it by trying multiple times, after
conducting reconnaissance activity. Knowing who accesses the company
assets, creating decoys to lure attackers and gain time to implement
defense strategies could be a deal breaker. Learn more about what
honeypots are, how they can be used and what value they can provide to a
company.

</li>

<li>

Hacking: Nowadays we can see an increase in cyber-crime or state
controlled attacks and companies are starting to become more aware for
the need of people with a hacking culture. In Learning path, how to
become a hacker you will find a few steps on how you can be a good guy
into security and help organizations secure their environments.

</li>

<li>

Security Community Building: The founder and the coordinator of
CoderDojo will present the learning steps into security, how can we get
more insights if we participate into CTFs and how we can build a
stronger security community.

<b>Title: Be aware of your bugs, if you aren’t, someone else is</b>
The first session will introduce key concepts necessary in understanding
what is going on “under the hood” of your program and how this
correlates with being a possible victim of an exploit.

We will also dissect a real life exploit to see how this is done “in the
wild” and what can we do to prevent it.
