## OWASP Timisoara \#21: 23 June 2022
The next OWASP Timisoara Chapter Meeting will be online.

> Theme sessions - Theme: Recon, Vulnerabilities, Bug Hunting

`Schedule`

Introduction, OWASP News & Updates - Catalin Curelaru

Work harder, not smarter! - Daniel Tomescu (KPMG)

Recon tips and tricks - Alexis Fernandez (Visma)

**`Time:`**` 18:30 to 20:30`

`More about the speakers and topics`

Daniel Tomescu - Senior Manager / Ethical Hacker @KPMG

Daniel is a Senior Manager and Ethical Hacker at KPMG Romania by day. By night, Daniel is a Bug Bounty Hunter and Curious Security Researcher.

*Work harder, not smarter!*
Asbtract: Every memorable presentation within the infosec community teaches you how to enumerate more, automate everything and generally work "smarter" by letting cool tools do the job for you even when you sleep. But what if you are the kind of person which likes to get their hands dirty and actually find vulnerabilities the old-fashioned way? In the age of speed, is it still possible for hard work to beat automation? This presentation will highlight the advantages of actually putting hard work into exploiting the unexploitable and the difference it makes in terms of impact.


Alexis Fernandez - Read Team engineer @Visma

Read Team operator at Visma, pentester and bug hunter with extensive experience in Linux systems administration and programming. In love with assets recon and discovery techniques. ReconFTW and PentestBook author.

*Recon tips and tricks*
Abstract:In this talk I will explain some hidden gems to perform a better and deeper reconnaissance of your targets, especially when it comes to subdomains enumeration, but also the rest of the phases.

## OWASP Timisoara \#20: 09 December 2021
The next OWASP Timisoara Chapter Meeting will be online.

> Winter sessions - Theme: AI, Bug Bounty & Web Fuzzing
`Schedule`

Introduction, OWASP News & Updates - Catalin Curelaru

AI in Security - Robbe Van Roey (Intigriti)

FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ****ed ... (The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing) - Joona Hoikkala (Visma)

**`Time:`**` 18:30 to 20:30`

`More about the speakers and topics`

Robbe Van Roey - Hacker Manager @ Intigriti

Robbe Van Roey or better known as PinkDraconian finished his studies in AI & robotics, but because of his passion for cybersecurity, he became the Hacker Manager for the popular bug bounty platform Intigriti. Besides his work life, he runs a YouTube channel where he details challenges, CVEs, and all kinds of cybersecurity related topics in videos. Check him out on twitter (@PinkDraconian) 

*AI in Security*
Asbtract: Artificial intelligence has been the driving development factor in many industries over the past decade, but what about the cybersecurity industry? In this presentation, I would like to introduce all of you into what AI could mean for you in the cybersecurity field. We're going on a journey on what is possible and what will be possible when combining AI with cybersecurity.


Joona Hoikkala - Red Team Manager @Visma

Working as red team manager at Visma, Joona is a hacker that has experience from multiple vantage points and aspects of information security, software development and brewing. He's an open so(u)rcerer and has built or contributed to a wide variety of security tools, both offensive and defensive. This talk is discussing both positive and negative phenomenom around a web fuzzing tool he built and maintains: ffuf, or: "fuzz faster u fool".

*FFUF - Fuzz Faster, U're ****ed ... The good, the bad and the ugly of web fuzzing*
Abstract:Web fuzzing is a powerful method for automating the boring tasks in both black box, and gray box testing of web applications. There's only so much one can do when approaching this kind of target manually but with proper tooling the server resources are the only limit. Wait? Server resources being the limit?

Penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, security researchers and criminals are using the same techniques for different purposes. What happens when you are able to send tens of thousands of requests from your laptop, over the internet to a target. What if you scale it up horizontally, doing the same thing from hundreds of sources? What if the responding endpoint is intentionally slow - a login for example?

At the cloud-native age, rate limiting might seem as an ancient thing from a distant past but for the very same reasons it's more relevant than ever...

## OWASP Timisoara \#19: 17 June 2021
The next OWASP Timisoara Chapter Meeting will be online.
> Summer sessions - Theme: Threat Modeling & Iterative Security

`Schedule`

Introduction, OWASP News & Updates - Catalin Curelaru

She is a passionate researcher having the goal of simplifying the use of security services within Agile development. She leads the security development team in Visma and conducts research on security in agile software development

Dr. Daniela S. Cruzes, Professor @ Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)

Dr. Daniela S. Cruzes is a Professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist at SINTEF in Norway. She has also been a researcher fellow at the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering-Maryland.

Her research interests are empirical software engineering, research methods and theory development, synthesis of SE studies, software security, software testing and agile and DevOps


*Challenges and Experiences with Threat Modeling in Agile Development Projects*

Abstract: The goal of secure software engineering is to create software that keeps performing as intended even when exposed to attacks. Threat modeling is considered to be a key activity, but can be challenging to perform for developers, and even more so in agile software development. Hence, threat modeling has not seen widespread use in agile software projects. The goal of the presentation is to show some of these challenges and approaches that the teams are working on.

Dario Cavallaro, Security Customer Success Specialists @ Cisco.

*Security through an iterative process*

Abstract: Security through an iterative process is a collection of notes collected in 15+ years' experience. We will go through what has worked for most companies, some myths and some of the common things that are typically missing, but that everybody wants.

## OWASP Timisoara \#18: 18 March 2021
> Spring sessions - Theme: Security Automation & Intelligence, Code Patters

`More about the speakers and topics`

Teofil Cojocariu, Application Security Engineering Lead @ Betfair Development Romania.

I'm focused on Application Security Engineering & Penetration Testing combined with CAMS mindset (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing - DevSecOps) and I reported security bugs to Google, Facebook, Uber, Bitdefender, ING Bank, Yahoo or other companies. One of the most interesting thing is that I built a platform "Surface - Security Intelligence Automation Platform" which is being used by more than 900 people in Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter and I was the Security SME for a Private Cloud based on OpenStack with environments as code.

*Surface Security - Security Intelligence Automation Platform*

Abstract: Our external attack surface is constantly growing, which gives external attackers the opportunity to continuously search for new attack vectors. In order to successfully respond to Security incidents we needed a centralized platform which aggregates all the data about our premises in a single place.

Surface Security (Security Intelligence Automation Platform) is an internally built tool which assists our internal Security teams to gain a holistic view about our externally exposed assets. More than that, it facilitates faster incident response based on the information correlated by it. Surface started as a small project in which we tried to close the gaps identified in our security controls. The platform's core is built in Django which is a Python-based open-source framework which has a fast learning curve. Besides Django, we're using technologies like Ansible (automation), Dkron (fault-tolerant jobs), Elasticsearch (Security metrics storage) and Grafana (reporting). During the whole period it gained a lot of traction in our company determining people to contribute to its success by implementing and suggesting new features. We're currently utilizing it for reporting the Security gaps to other areas of key business areas and for Security controls like: monitoring our externally exposed assets, vulnerability management, security incidents, bug bounty reports and penetration testing.

Bence Nagy, software engineer @ r2c.

Bence Nagy is a software engineer at r2c, working on Semgrep, an open-source syntax-aware code search tool. At r2c, his responsibilities tend towards building various interfaces atop the core semgrep CLI. These include CI integrations, editor extensions, and the semgrep.dev web app. He previously led a developer experience team at Kiwi.com, the Czech Republic’s top startup at the time of its acquisition in 2019. You should totally ask him for video game recommendations after the talk.`

*Detect complex code patterns using semantic grep*

Abstract: We’ll discuss a program analysis tool we’re developing called Semgrep. It's a multilingual semantic tool for writing security and correctness queries on source code (for Python, Java, Go, C, and JS) with a simple “grep-like” interface. The original author, Yoann Padioleau, worked on Semgrep’s predecessor, Coccinelle, for Linux kernel refactoring, and later developed Semgrep while at Facebook. He’s now full time with us at r2c.

Semgrep is a free open-source program analysis toolkit that finds bugs using custom analysis we’ve written and OSS code checks. Semgrep is ideal for security researchers, product security engineers, and developers who want to find complex code patterns without extensive knowledge of ASTs or advanced program analysis concepts.

## OWASP Timisoara \#17: 03 December 2020
Online Event - Due to #COVID19 in #Romania, we have to make the announcement that the #17 OWASP Timisoara Chapter meetup will be ONLINE.
Winter sessions - Theme: Hackers Mindset + Web Indexing and Crawlers

`More about the speakers and topics`

Per Olsson(repolsson), Application Security Engineer at Visma.
Per has a background as a developer focusing on the security aspects of software development, he has an unhealthy obsession with passwords and understanding the human behind the hoodie.

*Hackers and the hacker mindset*
Abstract: Per will talk about what hacking actually is, how a hacker thinks compared to for example a developer and about a few different types of hackers.

Tom Hudson (TomNomNom), Security Research Tech Lead at Detectify.
Tom is from Bradford in the UK and he is a Open-source tool maker, trainer, talker, fixer, eater, not really a sheep.

*The Unsearchables - Finding Things That Google Doesn't*
Abstract: Google does a fine job of indexing the web for most purposes, but we often want to find things that "regular" people aren't so interested in. Let's take a look at some places you can look, and some techniques you can use to find things that Google doesn't index. We'll look at digging into git repository histories, Docker images, and a few other things to find secrets and other useful information.

Winter sessions - Theme: Honeypots, Hacking and Community Building

<li>

Honeypots: The internet is getting bigger and bigger and the attacks on
organisations, governments, individuals etc are increasing. It's not a
matter of if you're going to be a target, but when. At some point in
time, attackers will find a way to enter a company's network, some way
or another. They usually do it by trying multiple times, after
conducting reconnaissance activity. Knowing who accesses the company
assets, creating decoys to lure attackers and gain time to implement
defense strategies could be a deal breaker. Learn more about what
honeypots are, how they can be used and what value they can provide to a
company.

</li>

<li>

Hacking: Nowadays we can see an increase in cyber-crime or state
controlled attacks and companies are starting to become more aware for
the need of people with a hacking culture. In Learning path, how to
become a hacker you will find a few steps on how you can be a good guy
into security and help organizations secure their environments.

</li>

<li>

Security Community Building: The founder and the coordinator of
CoderDojo will present the learning steps into security, how can we get
more insights if we participate into CTFs and how we can build a
stronger security community.
